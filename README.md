## Overview

This project analyzes crime rates in **New York City (NYC)** using publicly available datasets, exploring correlations between crime rates and socio-economic factors such as education, health, public safety, and social services. The project was implemented using **Tableau**, leveraging interactive visualizations to identify trends and hotspots in NYC.

## Objective

- Identify crime-prone areas and patterns based on geographical, temporal, and demographic data.
- Examine how education, health services, and social services influence crime rates.
- Provide actionable insights to policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and community organizations to improve public safety.

## Dataset

The analysis was conducted using multiple datasets related to crime, education, health, and social services. After data cleaning and merging, the final dataset consisted of approximately 50,000 rows and 15-20 columns, covering:
- **Crime Reports:** Type, location, time, and demographics of reported crimes.
- **Education Data:** Graduation rates, literacy levels, and school performance.
- **Health Indicators:** Hospital admissions, mental health statistics, and STD rates.
- **Social Services Data:** Utilization of government aid and community services.

## Key Insights & Findings

- **Crime Hotspots:** The highest crime rates were observed in Brooklyn and the Bronx, while Staten Island had the lowest crime rates.
- **Temporal Patterns:** Crime rates peaked in July and October, with night-time crimes more prevalent than daytime crimes.

- **Demographic Analysis:**
  - A significant percentage of arrests were associated with Black and White Hispanic individuals.
  - Assault-related crimes were the most frequent offenses across all demographics.

- **Premises-Based Crime Trends:**
  - Manhattan had higher crime rates in commercial locations (e.g., food establishments, financial institutions).
  - Brooklyn and Bronx showed high crime rates in residential and outdoor areas.

## Visualization Highlights

- **Heat Maps:** Showed crime density across different NYC boroughs.
- **Time-Series Graphs:** Illustrated crime trends across different months.
- **Bar Charts:** Displayed the top 5 most common crimes in each area.
- **Filters & Interactive Features:** Allowed users to drill down by age, gender, race, borough, and time of day.

## Dashboard & Usage

The Tableau dashboard provides an interactive way to explore crime trends by adjusting various filters. Users can:
- View crime distribution across different boroughs and premises.
- Analyze crime trends by time of the day and month.
- Compare crime rates across different racial and age groups.
- Identify the most common crimes in specific areas.

## Limitations & Future Improvements:

- Data Limitations:
  - Some missing values in crime reports may introduce biases.
  - The dataset lacks real-time updates, limiting predictive analysis.

- Future Enhancements:
  - Incorporate additional datasets such as law enforcement presence and economic conditions.
  - Use machine learning to predict future crime trends based on historical data.
  - Develop a real-time crime alert system for better decision-making.

## Conclusion:
This project highlights how data visualization can offer critical insights into crime patterns, helping stakeholders take informed actions to improve community safety in NYC.
